    "\n",
    "# Why Choose a Linear Mixed Model Over a Repeated Measures ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons for preferring a **linear mixed model (LMM)** over a traditional **repeated measures ANOVA** in many experimental settings: https://vsni.co.uk/blogs/anova-vs-linear-mixed-models-choosing-the-right-tool-for-your-statistical-analysis/\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility with Missing Data:**\n",
    "   - **LMM:** Can handle missing data in a principled way (assuming data are missing at random) without discarding entire subjects. This is especially useful when some participants have incomplete data.\n",
    "   - **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Typically requires complete data for all conditions, so any missing value often leads to dropping the subject or employing imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Unbalanced Designs:**\n",
    "   - **LMM:** Can accommodate unbalanced data (e.g., different numbers of observations per participant) without requiring strict data balancing.\n",
    "   - **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Assumes a balanced design, which can limit its applicability if some conditions or trials have fewer observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modeling Random Effects:**\n",
    "   - **LMM:** Explicitly models random effects (like random intercepts or slopes for subjects), capturing inter-subject variability. This allows for a more accurate representation of the hierarchical structure of the data (e.g., repeated measurements nested within subjects).\n",
    "   - **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Often only implicitly accounts for within-subject correlations and may rely on assumptions like sphericity, which can be violated in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility in Covariance Structures:**\n",
    "   - **LMM:** Allows for the specification of different covariance structures to model the relationship between repeated measurements, which can be tailored to the data.\n",
    "   - **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Assumes compound symmetry (equal variances and covariances) unless corrections (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser) are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enhanced Inference:**\n",
    "   - **LMM:** Provides more flexibility in hypothesis testing, including the possibility of testing complex interactions and accommodating covariates.\n",
    "   - **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Can be more restrictive, especially when the data do not meet its underlying assumptions.\n",

These advantages are particularly beneficial in complex experimental designs where assumptions of traditional repeated measures ANOVA may not hold.\n",

    "- **Interactions:**\n",
    "  - Most interaction terms are not significant, except for the significant three-way interaction in **Trial 2**. This suggests that in **Trial 2**, the combination of using **WBC** with **WITH-VR** has a uniquely large effect on increasing `Total_Time`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Controller and Modality:**  \n",
    "  The analysis suggests that the **CHIRON** controller and the **WITHOUT-VR** condition may result in faster task completion times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Effects:**  \n",
    "  Although there is a trend indicating improvement over trials, these effects are not statistically robust in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combined Effects:**  \n",
    "  The significant three-way interaction in **Trial 2** warrants further investigation, as it indicates that the combination of **WBC** and **WITH-VR** in that trial has a unique impact on performance.\n"
