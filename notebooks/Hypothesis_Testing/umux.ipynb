    "A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was conducted to compare usability between with VR and without VR conditions. The results showed a significant decrease in UMUX scores in the WITH-VR condition (p = 0.0006), suggesting that participants perceived the VR condition as less usable compared to the non-VR setup. To evaluate whether controller type had an impact on usability, a Mann-Whitney U Test was conducted to compare SBC and WBC. The results showed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.2114), meaning that both controllers were rated similarly in terms of usability. This suggests that while VR negatively impacted usability perception, the choice of controller did not significantly influence participantsâ€™ usability ratings."
