SBC,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,without VR,"In sim it feels a lot lighter, mapping my movements, not getting much feedback from sim. Only visually (can't see the weight, sounds, force as in the real world). Being in the same room feels more immersive",Had to use the neck a lot to look around the scene (head movement). VR headset weights more.,It is fine for the most part. It would be nice to have a hpatic feedback to get back to convergence with the arm. Missed the 3rd person view from the real world. (With VR in real world). HTC Vive the fps of the headset and resolution.,Really liked the control scheme. The base felt really intuitive. Turning the body and legs comes very naturally. The arm controller is not so intuitive. The scaling of the movement of the robot and the person is different. It is fine moving the base and the arm at the same time. I didn't do it more because I fear that I will lose the convergence area when I try to move the base and the arm at the same time.
SBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,Same,Same,without VR,"Looked around in the room. With the screens, was in the same room.","Being in the same room gave more confidence to move the robots arm and base at the same time. Because of the time delay, don't trust the VR  so much. Thought he has going to bump into the drawer with the VR, but actually it was not so close (lack of embodiment perception)",Time delay of the cameras to improve confidence in the system. Convergence of inverse kinematics was hard for embodiment movements of the arm.,"The task was boring, but it was fun either way because of the setup"
SBC,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,Same,with VR,with VR,"In the real world, the embodiment felt more natural than in sim. The time delay in the sim (fps) affected the efficiency in sim. Tried to be more safe when controlling the robot.","Without the VR, since it is in the same room, it is easier to estimate how close the robot is to stuff. Controls the robot with more confidence without the VR. Opening the drawer with the screens was easier than with the headset. But picking up the bottle was easier with the headset using the first person view (sense of embodiment).","Camera views could be wider. A 3rd person view camera would help, like in the sim. The base in unstable (more rigid), spring with higher stiffness.","Using the headset makes the experience more immersive, fun, since you perceive the embodiment, feels more natural. Like that without headset could see the robot in the same room. If he was not in the same room, it may not have been as fun. "
SBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Same,without VR,with VR,Same,with VR,Same,"In the real world had audio feedback, hear when touching something (grasping the bottle and so on). Higher fps of the cameras in the real world, get more immediate feedback for controlling the robot.","Was more aware of the environment without the headset, more cautious. ","Didn't expect it to work so well. Previously thought it would be hard to grasp the bottle, but it was easier.",It was fun
SBC,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,Same,"Similar, main difference is that in the real world was int he same room, was easier",With headset took more time to realize the depth perception because was constantly changing camera views (specially when dropping bottle in drawer and pick it up). ,With headset would be interesting to have some feedback for the distance to objects. Some pop up info. ,The teleop felt smooth without the headset
SBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Agree,with VR,with VR,without VR,Same,with VR,Same,"In the real world, paid more attention while controlling the base to avoid collision. In the real world would move the controller slower, more carefully. ","With the headset, felt like she could perceive the environment better in spite of the sickness. ","With the headset, it would be nice to decrease the delay from the camera stream (fps) and the position of the head camera is not so great, it would be better if it had a wider angle or was a bit back (inside the head), so could see own body (robot's body) better. The side cameras could also be positioned in a better way.","With the headset, it is easier to complete most tasks (except the parking task), for picking and placing is better, because can move the head camera and see around. First person view leverages the sense of embodiment better. Without the headset, The side angles helps for depth perception when reaching to grasp an object when the head camera is not enough."
SBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,without VR,"In simulation, had a lot of difficulties because of the delay of the stream and because of the time pressure (6 minutes limit). Had a hard time in sim to fish around to get back into convergence.","Without the headset felt more confident (bold, went fast) and could move the base and the arm at the same time. With the VR couldn't see the arm, so there was no visual feedback of the arm's pose.",Lowering the delay in sim,Liked that it felt immersive (Felt like he was Tiago).
SBC,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,without VR,"The simulation was laggy, so it was harder in simulation than in the real world. The depth perception in simulation was bad.","Without the headset you can see the robot so you know the orientation of the robot at all times. With the headset, you have to look at all the camera views to see where the robot is. When trying to reach for the robot, always missed the grasp of the bottle. Couldn't strech the arm directly to reach the bottle, always had to move the arm from left to right to grasp bottle.","As said before, if the head camera could see the robot's body it would be easier. Another 3rd person view camera to see from above the global pose of the robot. It would be easier to move around and park the robot.","Cool experience to teloperate, specially with own body movements and not only with a joystrick. "

(Both simulation and in the real world). Tried to estimate distance of robot to avoid collision. In simulation used more the head camera than in the real world. In the real world used the side cameras to make sure wouldn't collide.",With the headset had a better sense of embodiment and tried to move the body as if she was the robot. (Leaned forward without the headset to try to get a better view of the room).,"The depth perception was not good enough for picking the bottle, so failed some times.",Can't teleoperate a robot in any other situation
WBC,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Agree,without VR,Same,without VR,Same,with VR,without VR,In the real-world was more careful because could cause damage. In general felt like the controller in real world were smoother than in sim.,"Had more confidence moving the base without the headset, because could see exactly where the robot is and no need to rely on the camera views.",Would add a 3rd person view camera like in the sim so that the pose of robot could be seen with the VR better (also for parking specially).,Liked that you can look around the head camera when using the VR. 
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Agree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,Only noticed the combined movement of arm and base in the real world. More lag in the camera stream from simulation than in real world.,The position of the base and arm was easier to identify without VR and the drawer was easier to find without VR,It would be easier to control the base and the arm separately. The button for repositioning was tedious. The lag of the camera stream could be solved in a better way. The positioning of the side cameras could provide a better angle.,"Fun task, it wasn't too hard neither too easy. Nice sense of accomplishment after dropping the bottle in drawer. Nice to see own movements being replicated by the robot."
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,In the simulation with screens was easier than in the real world with the screens. ,With the headset on was harder to move. Hard to coordinate camera views. Noticed a lag in the camera head movement of the robot. In the simulation also.,Clearer view because couldn't get the depth perception accurately (bottle had black tape and end-effector was also black). Couldn't see if the end-effector was closed or opened.,"Felt like it was a game, wanted to succeed."
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,without VR,Not really,"Closing the drawer different strategies, but it was because of the experience. Couldn't park well with the VR, only task that was very very hard with the VR. ","With the VR, would put an extra 3rd person view camera so that can park the robot.",Had fun (:
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,with VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,Same,Was more cautious with the real robot.,With the headset searched for reference points and standard poses of the arm from which he knew how to teleoperate to a new joint position. The delay without the headset interfered less with the performance. Without the headset had a 3rd person view from behind that helped locate the robot better.,"It would be interesting if the robot's arm would follow mine (joint to joint tracking). Frame rate and lag of the camera stream. Wider field of view of the camera would be good. When moving the base, the base of the robot would overshoot a lot (jerk). ",Challenged himself to do the task as quickly as possible. had fun playing with the robot. Interesting to see the setup. 
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,with VR,without VR,"The depth perception in simulation was worse, harder to grasp the bottle. Moving the robot's base was simpler and more straight forward in the real world. The arm movement was also easier.","Moving the base was easier without the headset (understand where the robot was). That is why I could do it faster, since it was easier to position the base then could reposition more easily - quote. Finding the handle and the bottle was easier with the headset because could get a good view with the head camera. With the headset there waere a few times where couldn't see the arm so didn't know where it was, afraid that the arm could hit something. Didn't want to move the head too much because was filling sick.",The camera poses could be better (more towards the bottle or the drawer - it would be easier to pick up). ,"Controlling the robot was cool, specially without the headset because could control it and see it move.

WBC,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,Same,without VR,Felt like the distance to the objects in simulation was off.,Wo the headset positioned the robot in a strategic way so that could see bottle without looking at screens.,Make a user study comparing usage of headset and not without robot in the same room. Camera stream was very blurry.,Liked that could see her progress over the trials.
WBC,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,"Nothing related to the sim. With practice got better, doesn't know if it was related to the sim and in the real world. Maybe in sim couldn't see that well how the robot is and real world yes.","Without the headset, almost never used the screens except for picking up the bottle because the robot was blocking view.","Improve quality of cameras views and latency. Didn't really use the remapping of the frame, but realized that the robot kept rotating when trying to translate the robot.",Liked teleoperating the robot without the headset. With the headset doesnt think could have done a 4th round.
WBC,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,In simulation couldn't perceive that the arm was fully extended.,Without the headset positioned the robot so that it wouldn't occlude the view to the bottle. With the headset switched camera views to get a better understanding of depth perception.,Allow the person to teleoperate without being sit.,It was fun
SBC,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Slightly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Slightly Disagree,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,without VR,In simulation felt like couldn't move the arm so well mainly because didn't know how it would react and in real world had more visual feedback of what was going on and could control the arm better. Afraid to break the robot in real life so was more cautious.,"With the headset had to guess the orientation of the spot more, had to think about it more. Tried not to use only the screens (without the headset) but also look at the robot in the room, felt easier.","It would be nicer if could see better to see the end-effector of the robot, specially to estimate how high it is to grasp the handle and also the bottle.",Liked that first had to practice in simulation to get used to the system and only then go to the real world. Had fun (:
