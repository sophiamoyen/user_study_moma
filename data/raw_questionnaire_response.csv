Afraid to break the robot in real life so was more cautious.,"With the headset had to guess the orientation of the spot more, had to think about it more. Tried not to use only the screens (without the headset) but also look at the robot in the room, felt easier.","It would be nicer if could see better to see the end-effector of the robot, specially to estimate how high it is to grasp the handle and also the bottle.",Liked that first had to practice in simulation to get used to the system and only then go to the real world. Had fun (:
